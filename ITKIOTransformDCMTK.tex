\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes a module that extends the Insight Toolkit,
ITK \url{www.itk.org}, which reads DICOM Spatial Registration Object files into
\doxygen{Transform}'s. Currently, DICOM files are read by applying the DCMTK
library as a backend. A \code{itk::DCMTKTransformIO} class can be registered
with the IO factory mechanism so \doxygen{TransformFileReaderTemplate} will recognize
and read these files.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in
this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.

\tableofcontents

DICOM, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, is the standard for
medical images and related information~\cite{DICOMStandard}. As image registration
computational research has slowly been adopted into clinical practice,
DICOM has been extended to support registration information. Registration
is applied in medical practices such as radiotherapy~\cite{Pinter2012b}.

The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit, ITK, is a resource for
medical image analysis applied in both a research and clinical context. This
article describes a module~\cite{ITKModules} for ITK that makes it possible to read affine
transforms stored as DICOM files.

First, a brief background of how spatial transforms are stored in DICOM is
presented. Next, an overview of transforms are handled in the proposed module
code is described. A concrete example showing how the module is applied
follows.  Finally, an overview describing next steps is given.


\section{DICOM Spatial Transform Background}

Regarding spatial transforms in DICOM, there are primarily three definitions to be
concerned with, a \textit{Frame of Reference}~\cite{DICOMFrameOfReference},
the \textit{Spatial Registration Information Object Definition
\(IOD\)}~\cite{DICOMSRO,DICOMSROSupp}, and the \textit{Deformable Spatial Registration
Information Object Definition \(IOD\)} \cite{DICOMSRO,DICOMDSROSupp}.

A \textit{Frame of Reference} identifies

The \textit{Spatial Registration IOD}

The \textit{Deformable Spatial Registration IOD}

\section{ITK Interface to DICOM Transforms}

Modern Image Processing is most of the time performed with computers. An
attempt to replicate the results of an algorithm described in a paper entails
to reimplement the algorithm into source code. This task is far from trivial
and consumes months of work. The final result can not be guarranted to be
equivalent to the actual code that was used for testing the algorithm when the
paper was written, and therefore it cannot be considered a baseline for
comparing the algoritm with other algorithms availble to the reader.

Papers to the Insight Journal are written in the spirit of facilitating and
encouraging readers to perform replication of work. In this sense, the Insight
Journal is compliant with essential concepts of the scientific method.

Since the code is included with the paper, less time has to be spent in
describing the code, and more time can be used for describing how to use the
algorithm in particular types of images.

For questions on the basis of the scientific method the reader is refered to
\cite{Popper2002,Popper1971}.



\section{Example}

The format of this LaTeX file, allows authors to include code snippets, like
the following

\small
\begin{verbatim}
typedef itk::Image< unsigned char, 3 > ImageType;

ImageType::Pointer image = ImageType::New();
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

and to cite the online documentation of the Insitght Toolkit, for example, the
link to the doxygen documentation of the ImageToImageFilter

\doxygen{ImageToImageFilter}

LaTeX macros are also available for typesetting code in familiar courier fonts.
Like the following method of an ITK class.

\code{SetNumberOfIterations()}

\section{Future Work}

While reading the Spatial Registration IOD is now possible, future work could
entail adding write support. Support for Deformable Registration IOD's could
also be added, which correspond to an \doxygen{CompositeTransform} of affine
transforms and the \doxygen{DisplacementFieldTransform}.  While the low-level
reading of the DICOM files is currently achieved with the DCMTK library, similar
calls could be performed to create a GDCM library-based implementation.


% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:

To support shape-guidance, the generic level set equation
(Eqn(~\ref{eqn:ShapeInfluenceTerm})) is extended to incorporate a shape guidance
term:

\xi \left(\psi^{*}(\mathbf{x}) - \psi(\mathbf{x})\right)
