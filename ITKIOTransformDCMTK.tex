\noindent
This document describes a module that extends the Insight Toolkit,
ITK \url{www.itk.org}, which reads DICOM Spatial Registration Object files into
\doxygen{Transform}'s. Currently, DICOM files are read by applying the DCMTK
library as a backend. An \code{itk::DCMTKTransformIO} class can be registered
with the IO factory mechanism so \doxygen{TransformFileReaderTemplate} will recognize
and read these files.

This paper is accompanied with the source code, input data, parameters and
output data that the authors used for validating the algorithm described in
this paper. This adheres to the fundamental principle that scientific
publications must facilitate reproducibility of the reported results.

\tableofcontents

DICOM, Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, is the standard for
medical images and related information~\cite{DICOMStandard}. As image registration
computational research has been adopted into clinical practice,
DICOM has been extended to support registration information. Registration
is applied in medical practices such as radiotherapy~\cite{Pinter2012b}.

The Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit, ITK, is a resource for
medical image analysis applied in both a research and clinical context. This
article describes a module~\cite{ITKModules} for ITK that makes it possible to read affine
transforms stored as DICOM files.

First, a brief background of how spatial transforms are stored in DICOM is
presented. Next, an overview of transforms are handled in the proposed module
code is described. A concrete example showing how the module is applied
follows.  Finally, an overview describing next steps is given.


\section{DICOM Spatial Transform Background}

Regarding spatial transforms in DICOM, there are three definitions to
primarily be concerned with, the \textit{Frame of
Reference}~\cite{DICOMFrameOfReference}, the \textit{Spatial Registration
Information Object Definition \(IOD\)}~\cite{DICOMSRO,DICOMSROSupp}, and the
\textit{Deformable Spatial Registration Information Object Definition \(IOD\)}
\cite{DICOMSRO,DICOMDSROSupp}.

A \textit{Frame of Reference} identifies the coordinate system associated with
an image. The Frame of Reference Unique Identification Number (UID), tag
\code{(0020,0052)}, is associated with an image series. Frame of Reference
UID's are also used to identify the coordinate systems that a spatial
transform maps to and from.

The \textit{Spatial Registration IOD} describes DICOM files that store affine
spatial transforms between Frames of Reference. A single Spatial Registration
Object (SRO) can contain multiple transforms. All spatial transforms in a
SRO are with respect to a Reference Coordinate System, which is also
identified with a Frame of Reference UID.

The Reference Coordinate System could be the Frame of Reference UID for a
reference image that the other images were registered against. In this case,
one of the transforms stored in the SRO, which correponds to the transform for
the reference image, will be an identity transform. However, the Reference
Coordinate System could also be an independent coordinate system, such as when
the images are registered against an atlas.

The transform for each image series in a SRO can consist of a chain of rigid
or affine transforms.

The \textit{Deformable Spatial Registration IOD} is similar to the Spatial
Registration IOD, but displacement field transforms are also possible in the
chain of transforms.

\section{ITK Interface to DICOM Transforms}

ITK uses an object factory mechanisms to support reading multiple file
formats.  For images, classes that read and write specific file formats
inherit from the \doxygen{ImageIOBase}, and the \doxygen{ImageFileReader} uses
the objects registered to the factory to attempt to read, then read, a given
file.  Similarly, the classes that inherit \doxygen{TransformIOBaseTemplate}
to read specific transform file formats are registered in the factory, and
\doxygen{TransformFileReaderTemplate} uses this factory to read a given
transform file name.

We wrote an \code{itk::DCMTKTransformIO} class that inherits from
\doxygen{TransformIOBaseTemplate}, and can read DICOM SRO files. Internally,
this class uses the DCMTK library~\cite{DCMTK} to read the file.

Since a sequence of transforms is possible, \code{itk::DCMTKTransformIO}
generates a \doxygen{CompositeTransform}. The ITK transforms that correspond
to the various DICOM transform types are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:TransformType}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{DICOM Type} & \textbf{ITK Type} \\
    \hline
    RIGID\_SCALE & \doxygen{ScaleTransform} \\
    \hline
    RIGID & \doxygen{Euler3DTransform} \\
    \hline
    AFFINE & \doxygen{AffineTransform} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:TransformType}
  \caption[DICOM and ITK transform types.]{DICOM transform types and their
    corresponding ITK transform type.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The default output of the DCMTKTransformIO is the concatenation of all
transforms found in the SRO in the resulting \doxygen{CompositeTransform}. To request
only the transforms corresponding to a specific Frame of Reference, call
\code{SetFrameOfReferenceUID}.

To find the spatial transform between the Frame of Reference for a Fixed Image
and the Frame of Reference for a Moving Image, first obtain the transform for
the Fixed Image,

\begin{equation}
  T_f = T_{f1} \circ T_{f2} \circ ... T_{fN} = T_{f1}( T_{f2}( ... T_{fN} ))
\end{equation}

where $T_f$ is the Fixed Image composite transform to the Reference Coordinate
System. The component transforms, $T_{f1}, T_{f2}, ...$ are a sequence of
rigid, scale, or affine transforms.

If the Frame of Reference is specified for the Moving Image composite
transform to the Reference Coordinate System, $T_m$,

\begin{equation}
  T_m = T_{m1} \circ T_{m2} \circ ... T_{mN} = T_{m1}( T_{m2}( ... T_{mN} ))
\end{equation}

then the transform from the Fixed Image Frame of Reference to the Moving Image
Frame of Reference is

\begin{equation}
  T_{fm} = T_m^{-1} \circ T_f = T_m^{-1}( T_f )
\end{equation}

where $T_m^{-1}$ is the inverse of the moving transform.

\section{Future Work}

While reading the Spatial Registration IOD is now possible, future work could
entail adding write support. Support for Deformable Registration IOD's could
also be added, which correspond to an \doxygen{CompositeTransform} of affine
transforms and the \doxygen{DisplacementFieldTransform}.  While the low-level
reading of the DICOM files is currently achieved with the DCMTK library, similar
calls could be performed to create a GDCM library-based implementation.
